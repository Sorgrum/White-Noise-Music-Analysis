	        <p> The station wagons arrived at noon, a long shining line that coursed through the westcampus. In single file they eased around the orange I-beam sculpture and moved toward thedormitories. The roofs of the station wagons were loaded down with carefully secured suitcasesfull of light and heavy clothing; with boxes of blankets, boots and shoes, stationery and books,sheets, pillows, quilts; with rolled-up rugs and sleeping bags; with bicycles, skis, rucksacks,English and Western saddles, inflated rafts. As cars slowed to a crawl and stopped, studentssprang out and raced to the rear doors to begin removing the objects inside; the stereo sets,radios, personal computers; small refrigerators and table ranges; the cartons of phonographrecords and cassettes; the hairdryers and styling irons; the tennis rackets, soccer balls, hockeyand lacrosse sticks, bows and arrows; the controlled substances, the birth control pills anddevices; the jurik food still in shopping bags—onion-and-garlic chips, nacho thins, peanutcreme patties, Waffelos and Kabooms, fruit chews and toffee popcorn; the Dum-Dum pops, theMystic mints.I've witnessed this spectacle every September for twenty-one years. It is a brilliant event,invariably. The students greet each other with comic cries and gestures of sodden collapse.Their summer has been bloated with criminal pleasures, as always. The parents stand sun-dazed near their automobiles, seeing images of themselves in every direction. Theconscientious suntans. The well-made faces and wry looks. They feel a sense of renewal, of communal recognition. The women crisp and alert, in diet trim, knowing people's names. Theirhusbands content to measure out the time, distant but ungrudging, accomplished inparenthood, something about them suggesting massive insurance coverage. This assembly of station wagons, as much as anything they might do in the course of the year, more than formalliturgies or laws, tells the parents they are a collection of the like-minded and the spirituallyakin, a people, a nation.I left my office and walked down the hill and into town. There are houses in town with turretsand two-story porches where people sit in the shade of ancient maples. There are Greek revivaland Gothic churches. There is an insane asylum with an elongated portico, ornamenteddormers and a steeply pitched roof topped by a pineapple finial. Babette and I and our childrenby previous marriages live at the end of a quiet street in what was once a wooded area withdeep ravines. There is an expressway beyond the backyard now, well below us, and at night aswe settle into our brass bed the sparse traffic washes past, a remote and steady murmuraround our sleep, as of dead souls babbling at the edge of a dream.I am chairman of the department of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill. I invented Hitlerstudies in North America in March of 1968. It was a cold bright day with intermittent winds outof the east. When I suggested to the chancellor that we might build a whole departmentaround Hitler's life and work, he was quick to see the possibilities. It was an immediate andelectrifying success. The chancellor went on to serve as adviser to Nixon, Ford and Carter before his death on a ski lift in Austria.<br />At Fourth and Elm, cars turn left for the supermarket. A policewoman crouched inside aboxlike vehicle patrols the area looking for cars parked illegally, for meter violations, lapsedinspection stickers. On telephone poles all over town there are homemade signs concerning lostdogs and cats, sometimes in the handwriting of a child. <br /><br /> Babette is tall and fairly ample; there is a girth and heft to her. Her hair is a fanatical blondmop, a particular tawny hue that used to be called dirty blond. If she were a petite woman, thehair would be too cute, too mischievous and contrived. Size gives her tousled aspect a certainseriousness. Ample women do not plan such things. They lack the guile for conspiracies of thebody."You should have been there," I said to her."Where?""It's the day of the station wagons.""Did I miss it again? You're supposed to remind me.""They stretched all the way down past the music library and onto the interstate. Blue, green,burgundy, brown. They gleamed in the sun like a desert caravan.""You know I need reminding, Jack."Babette, disheveled, has the careless dignity of someone too preoccupied with seriousmatters to know or care what she looks like. Not that she is a gift-bearer of great things as theworld generally reckons them. She gathers and tends the children, teaches a course in an adulteducation program, belongs to a group of volunteers who read to the blind. Once a week shereads to an elderly man named Treadwell who lives on the edge of town. He is known as OldMan Treadwell, as if he were a landmark, a rock formation or brooding swamp. She reads tohim from the National Enquirer, the National Examiner, the National Express, the Globe, the World, the Star. The old fellow demands his weekly dose of cult mysteries. Why deny him? Thepoint is that Babette, whatever she is doing, makes me feel sweetly rewarded, bound up with afull-souled woman, a lover of daylight and dense life, the miscellaneous swarming air of families. I watch her all the time doing things in measured sequence, skillfully, with seemingease, unlike my former wives, who had a tendency to feel estranged from the objective world—a self-absorbed and high-strung bunch, with ties to the intelligence community."It's not the station wagons I wanted to see. What are the people like? Do the women wearplaid skirts, cable-knit sweaters? Are the men in hacking jackets? What's a hacking jacket?""They've grown comfortable with their money," I said. "They genuinely believe they'reentitled to it. This conviction gives them a kind of rude health. They glow a little."I have trouble imagining death at that income level," she said."Maybe there is no death as we know it. Just documents changing hands.""Not that we don't have a station wagon ourselves.""It's small, it's metallic gray, it has one whole rusted door.""Where is Wilder?" she said, routinely panic-stricken, calling out to the child, one of hers,sitting motionless on his tricycle in the backyard.Babette and I do our talking in the kitchen. The kitchen and the bedroom are the majorchambers around here, the power haunts, the sources. She and I are alike in this, that weregard the rest of the house as storage space for furniture, toys, all the unused objects of earlier marriages and different sets of children, the gifts of lost in-laws, the hand-me-downsand rummages. Things, boxes. Why do these possessions carry such sorrowful weight? There isa darkness attached to them, a foreboding. They make me wary not of personal failure anddefeat but of something more general, something large in scope and content.She came in with Wilder and seated him on the kitchen counter. Denise and Steffie camedownstairs and we talked about the school supplies they would need. Soon it was time forlunch. We entered a period of chaos and noise. We milled about, bickered a little, dropped utensils. Finally we were all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch from the cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each other and we began quietly plastering mustard ormayonnaise on our brightly colored food. The mood was one of deadly serious anticipation, areward hard-won. The table was crowded and Babette and Denise elbowed each other twice,although neither spoke. Wilder was still seated on the counter surrounded by open cartons,crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances covered with plasticwrap, flip-top rings and twist ties, individually wrapped slices of orange cheese. Heinrich camein, studied the scene carefully, my only son, then walked out the back door and disappeared."This isn't the lunch I'd planned for myself," Babette said. "I was seriously thinking yogurtand wheat germ.""Where have we heard that before?" Denise said."Probably right here," Steffie said."She keeps buying that stuff.""But she never eats it," Steffie said."Because she thinks if she keeps buying it, she'll have to eat it just to get rid of it. It's likeshe's trying to trick herself.""It takes up half the kitchen.""But she throws it away before she eats it because it goes bad," Denise said. "So then shestarts the whole thing all over again.""Wherever you look," Steffie said, "there it is.""She feels guilty if she doesn't buy it, she feels guilty if she buys it and doesn't eat it, shefeels guilty when she sees it in the fridge, she feels guilty when she throws it away.""It's like she smokes but she doesn't," Steffie said.Denise was eleven, a hard-nosed kid. She led a more or less daily protest against those of her mother's habits that struck her as wasteful or dangerous. I defended Babette. I told her Iwas the one who needed to show discipline in matters of diet. I reminded her how much I likedthe way she looked. I suggested there was an honesty inherent in bulkiness if it is just the rightamount. People trust a certain amount of bulk in others. But she was not happy with her hips and thighs, walked at a rapid clip, ran up the stadiumsteps at the neoclassical high school.She said I made virtues of her flaws because it was my nature to shelter loved ones from thetruth. Something lurked inside the truth, she said.The smoke alarm went off in the hallway upstairs, either to 'et us know the battery had justdied or because the house was on fire. We finished our lunch in silence. Department heads wear academic robes at the College-on-the-Hill. Not grand sweeping full-length affairs but sleeveless tunics puckered at the shoulders. I like the idea. I like clearing myarm from the folds of the garment to look at my watch. The simple act of checking the time istransformed by this flourish. Decorative gestures add romance to a life. Idling students maysee time itself as a complex embellishment, a romance of human consciousness, as theywitness the chairman walking across campus, crook'd arm emerging from his medieval robe,the digital watch blinking in late summer dusk. The robe is black, of course, and goes withalmost anything.There is no Hitler building as such. We are quartered in Centenary Hall, a dark brick structurewe share with the popular culture department, known officially as American environments. Acurious group. The teaching staff is composed almost solely of New York émigrés, smart,thuggish, movie-mad, trivia-crazed. They are here to decipher the natural language of theculture, to make a formal method of the shiny pleasures they'd known in their Europe-shadowed childhoods—an Aristotelianism of bubble gum wrappers and detergent jingles. Thedepartment head is Alfonse (Fast Food) Stompanato, a broad-chested glowering man whosecollection of prewar soda pop bottles is on permanent display in an alcove. All his teachers aremale, wear rumpled clothes, need haircuts, cough into their armpits. Together they look liketeamster officials assembled to identify the body of a mutilated colleague. The impression is one of pervasive bitterness, suspicion and intrigue.An exception to some of the above is Murray Jay Siskind, an ex-sportswriter who asked me tohave lunch with him in the dining room, where the institutional odor of vaguely defined foodaroused in me an obscure and gloomy memory. Murray was new to the Hill, a stoop-shoulderedman with little round glasses and an Amish beard. He was a visiting lecturer on living icons andseemed embarrassed by what he'd gleaned so far from his colleagues in popular culture."I understand the music, I understand the movies, I even see how comic books can tell usthings. But there are full professors in this place who read nothing but cereal boxes.""It's the only avant-garde we've got.""Not that I'm complaining. I like it here. I'm totally enamored of this place. A small-townsetting. I want to be free of cities and sexual entanglements. Heat. This is what cities mean tome. You get off the train and walk out of the station and you are hit with the full blast. Theheat of air, traffic and people. The heat of food and sex. The heat of tall buildings. The heatthat floats out of the subways and the tunnels. It's always fifteen degrees hotter in the cities.Heat rises from the sidewalks and falls from the poisoned sky. The buses breathe heat. Heatemanates from crowds of shoppers and office workers. The entire infrastructure is based onheat, desperately uses up heat, breeds more heat. The eventual heat death of the universethat scientists love to talk about is already well underway and you can feel it happening allaround you in any large or medium-sized city. Heat and wetness.""Where are you living, Murray?""In a rooming house. I'm totally captivated and intrigued. It's a gorgeous old crumblinghouse near the insane asylum. Seven or eight boarders, more or less permanent except forme. A woman who harbors a terrible secret. A man with a haunted look. A man who nevercomes out of his room. A woman who stands by the letter box for hours, waiting for somethingthat never seems to arrive. A man with no past. A woman with a past. There is a smell aboutthe place of unhappy lives in the movies that I really respond to.""Which one are you?" I said."I'm the Jew. What else would I be?"There was something touching about the fact that Murray was dressed almost totally incorduroy. I had the feeling that since the age of eleven in his crowded plot of concrete he'dassociated this sturdy fabric with higher learning in some impossibly distant and tree-shadedplace."I can't help being happy in a town called Blacksmith," he said. "I'm here to avoid situations.Cities are full of situations, sexually cunning people. There are parts of my body I no longerencourage women to handle freely. I was in a situation with a woman in Detroit. She neededmy semen in a divorce suit. The irony is that I love women. I fall apart at the sight of long legs,striding, briskly, as a breeze carries up from the river, on a weekday, in the play of morninglight. The second irony is that it's not the bodies of women that I ultimately crave but theirminds. The mind of a woman. The delicate chambering and massive unidirectional flow, like aphysics experiment. What fun it is to talk to an intelligent woman wearing stockings as shecrosses her legs. That little staticky sound of rustling nylon can make me happy on severallevels. The third and related irony is that it's the most complex and neurotic and difficultwomen that I am invariably drawn to. I like simple men and complicated women."Murray's hair was tight and heavy-looking. He had dense brows, wisps of hair curling up thesides of his neck. The small stiff beard, confined to his chin and unaccompanied by a mustache,seemed an optional component, to be stuck on or removed as circumstances warranted."What kind of lectures do you plan giving?""That's exactly what I want to talk to you about," he said. "You've established a wonderfulthing here with Hitler. You created it, you nurtured it, you made it your own. Nobody on thefaculty of any college or university in this part of the country can so much as utter the wordHitler without a nod in your direction, literally or metaphorically. This is the center, theunquestioned source. He is now your Hitler, Gladney's Hitler. It must be deeply satisfying foryou. The college is internationally known as a result of Hitler studies. It has an identity, a senseof achievement. You've evolved an entire system around this figure, a structure with countlesssubstructures and interrelated fields of study, a history within history. I marvel at the effort. It </p>

	                <p><span class="song">Mass Destruction</span> <span class="by">by </span><span class="artist">Faithless</span></p>
	                <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     With its upbeat rhythm, the song Mass Destruction almost perfectly mimics a style of writing introduced by Delilio in <i>White Noise</i>. The ability of both Faithless's song and Delilo's writing to explore unnerving ideas with an almost cheerful way is awe-inspiring. The need to not only listen to Mass Destruction several times, but also read the lyrics to fully understand the subject of the song has an uncanny resemblance to Delilo's usage of lists to include a seemingly unrelated and usually saddening idea within a group of items. Delilo writes, “New sounds, a different flight path, a sense of being encased in a solid tubing and not some polyurethane wrap. The smoking sign went on, an international hand with a cigarette. Stewardesses appeared with scented towelettes for cleaning blood and vomit” (91). Even though Delilo writes about several objects to provide imagery for the reader, his list uses obscure and insignificant items like the smoking sign turning on to distract the reader from the idea that the entire plane almost crashed, making the whole event seem somehow discounted. Parallel to this, Faithless sings, “My dad came into my, room holding his hat, I knew he was leaving, He sat on my bed told me some facts, son. I have a duty, calling on me. You and your sister be brave my little soldier. And don't forget all I told ya. Your the mister of the house now remember this.” Even though he sings about a father going to war, leaving a small child as the man of the house, the encompassing of the lyrics in an upbeat, fast-tempo song, makes the entire message seem a lot lighter.</p>

                    <p><span class="song">Dust in the Wind</span> <span class="by">by </span><span class="artist">Kansas</span></p>
	                <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Acoustics and pitch perfects vocals symbolize Kansas. In their song Dust in the Wind, the analyzation of death, the fact that there can be no prolonging it, regardless of possessions and social class, shows a similar level of analysis practiced by Murray throughout the book. In the supermarket, Murray says, “Everything is concealed in symbolism, hidden by veils of mystery and layers of cultural material. But it is psychic data, absolutely. The large doors slide open, they close unbidden. Energy waves, incident radiation. All the letters and numbers are here, all the colors of the spectrum, all voices and sounds, all the code words and ceremonial phrases” (37). A study of a supermarket shows Murrays ability to take a complex object and break it down to its core and simplest form, similar to what Kansas does in Dust in the Wind. </p>

                    <p><span class="song">It Hasn't Been Long Enough</span> <span class="by">by </span><span class="artist">Eric Hutchinson</span></p>
	                <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     An extremely skillful musician Eric Hutchinson relies primarily on his ability to attune the sounds of the piano to match the tone of any of his songs. Similar to Delilo’s writings, Hutchinson can portray terrible events in a not as terrible way. Hutchinson sings, “It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright I'm only concerned with the way we end up.” In the context of <i>White Noise</i>, the quote applies perfectly to the idea of the fear of death found throughout the book. Jack says in <i>White Noise</i>, “That little breath of Nyodene has planted a death in my body. It is now official, according to the computer. I’ve got death inside me. It’s just a question of whether or not I can outlive it” (144). A paraphrase of Jack’s concern would be almost equivalent to Hutchinson’s lyrics.  </p>

	            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Babette is at first seen as a loving and trustworthy mother and wife. Throughout the story, she becomes less and less so.  The discovery of Babette taking Dylar and the fact that she had an affair to get it shows the intensity of the feelings she had towards death. In Jimmy Eat World’s Pain, he sings of an object that takes his pain away. This same concept can easily be fitted to Babette. The use of Dylar takes away the intense emotions brought on her by her fear of death. Seeking the help of an untested medical drug instead of a doctor or the advice of her husband shows the intense loneliness brought on her by her fear of death as well as the seriousness of her condition to her. </p>

	                <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     While it would no doubt be a little more than slightly uncomfortable to have this song played for you, the relationship between the singer Jermaine and Bret, his friend he is trying to cheer up, is very similar to the relationship between Murray and Jack. Murray at times can be very weird, exemplified when Murray has an interesting impulse to smell items residing in the Gladney’s cart. Delilo writes, “He took a twin roll of paper towels out of her cart and smelled it” (37). Regardless, as eccentric as Murray seems, he always provide Jack with advice when needed, similar to how Jermaine plays Bret a song to make him feel better.</p>

                    <p><span class="song">Nobody Home</span> <span class="by">by </span><span class="artist">Pink Floyd</span></p>
	                <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     A sense of randomness is apparent throughout <i>White Noise</i>. This is seen clearly when Denise tries to extract a confession from Babette about taking Dylar. A conversation that starts with a topic of an underground and experimental medical drug ends with Bolivians. Even though the beginning point of the conversation vastly differs from the end point, Delilo does not simply jump from one topic to another, he uses the flow of conversation to direct it to its final point. An example of this is when there is an ongoing conversation in the Gladney’s car, Babette asks, “Are you tellin me a two-hump camel stores food in one hump and water in the other?” and Heinrich responds, The important thing about camels, is that camel meat is considered a delicacy.” To which Denise responds, “I thought that was alligator meat” (81). Delilo does not jump from a discussion of camels to a discussion of alligator meat but rather uses the natural flow of conversation to make the randomness seem less obtrusive. This same concept is also found in Pink Floyd’s song, Nobody Home. Roger Waters sings, “I got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from” and continues on by singing, “I’ve got electric light.” Waters and Delilo both rapidly change from topic to topic to induce a sense of randomness, but both authors keep some sort of connection between them. </p>
